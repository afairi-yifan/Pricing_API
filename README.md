## Questions

1. What framework (tensorflow or pytorch) we are currently using?
2. api in the docker, do you mean put the endpoint to a docker container? 
3. From the draw.io, how to put docker container inside of vertex AI?
4. what machine learning model to be deployed?

## Structure

Online prediction to perform synchronous, low-latency response from our Vertax API prediction. 

1. Upload the model to the Registry
2. Provide the model to the endpoint.
3. Create online prediction based from the input.

### Testing model locally

Reference and work on the local model in this [notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/notebooks/community/vertex_endpoints/find_ideal_machine_type/find_ideal_machine_type.ipynb)


### Why?”; “What?”; “How?
